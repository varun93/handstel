# Handstel Android App

An application which interfaces with a Smartwatch, receives the location updates via SMS and visualizes on the the Google Maps. This application was reverse engineered by decompiling the apk which shipped with the smart watch using dex tools. The  location tracking module using Google Maps was added  and the app UI was modified.The screenshots are found in the **screenshots folder** and the code in **code folder**. The app was developed as a working prototype for the product Handstel in November 2014.

This application was made using Eclipse with AndroidSDK - Android Studio was still at its infancy. The project can still be imported as an Eclipse Project.
